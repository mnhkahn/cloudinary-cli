# Cloudinary CLI Uploader

Upload local files or remote URLs to Cloudinary with automatic image compression support.

## Workflow

### 1. Check Installation

Check if the CLI binary exists at `./cloudinary-cli` (project root). If not, run the install script:

```bash
bash skills/cloudinary-cli/scripts/install.sh
```

If Go is not installed, prompt the user to install Go first.

### 2. Check Configuration (`.env`)

Check if `cmd/cli/.env` exists and contains all required variables. If any are missing, prompt the user for the missing values and write them to `cmd/cli/.env`.

**Required variables:**
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD` - Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_KEY` - API key
- `CLOUDINARY_SECRET` - API secret

**Optional variables:**
- `CLOUDINARY_DIRECTORY` - Upload folder (default: root)
- `CLOUDINARY_COMPRESS` - Auto-compress images: `true`/`false` (default: `true`)

### 3. Upload Files

Run the upload script with file paths:

```bash
bash skills/cloudinary-cli/scripts/upload.sh <file1> [file2] ...
```

Or run the CLI directly:

```bash
cd cmd/cli && ../../cloudinary-cli file1.jpg file2.png
```

The CLI automatically:
- Compresses images when `CLOUDINARY_COMPRESS=true`
- Leaves non-image files untouched
- Supports both local paths and remote URLs

## Image Compression

When `CLOUDINARY_COMPRESS` is `true` (default), images are uploaded with Cloudinary `q_auto` transformation for automatic quality optimization. Supported image formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, bmp, tiff, svg, ico, heic, heif, avif.

To disable compression for a specific upload, temporarily set `CLOUDINARY_COMPRESS=false` in `.env`.
